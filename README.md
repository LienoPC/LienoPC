## Other Projects

### üéû "The Postman" Animation Reproduction
CGI reproduction of "The Postman" ad spot, project for the ‚ÄúComputer Animation‚Äù exam at Politecnico di Torino. Created a 30-second 3D-animated video using Blender; worked specifically on:
- Modeling, rigging and animation of the dog  
- Scene animation using modern keyframing and motion techniques
- Video sections on which I worked: 0:11-0:13; 0:18-0:23, 0:27-0:29 (fence)

### üÜõ Drag√≤n - 3D Environment
CGI render of an original environment, part of the project for "Computer Graphics" exam at Politecnico di Torino. Applied both classical and modern modeling techniques, including fluid simulation, sculpting, soft and rigid bodies, dynamic painting etc.
<br>Elements on which I worked:
- Censer modeling, material and rigidbody simulation for chains
- Lava simulation and material
- Dragon tooth
- Marble fence
- Marble material
- Walls and floor
