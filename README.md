- <b> Unreal Engine 5 Projects </b>
  <br>Self-driven projects developed for educational and skill-building purposes, aimed at mastering Unreal Engine 5 workflows and systems:
  - **Aura: Top-Down RPG (WIP)** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/LienoPC/Aura-GameplayAbilitySystem.git)
    - Implementing Gameplay Ability System to create scalable character abilities and effects in a top-down RPG game. Part of Stephen Ulibarri "Unreal Engine 5 - Gameplay Ability System" intermediate course.
  - **Slash: Soulslike Demo** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/LienoPC/UE5-StartingCourse-SlashProject.git)
    - Prototyped core combat mechanics inspired by Soulslike games, focusing on animation montages, hit detection, and simple enemy AI behavior, along with all basic tools provided by the engine. Project results of Stephen Ulibarri "Unreal Engine 5 C++ The Ultimate Game Developer Course" course completion.

- <b> OpenGL C++ </b>
  - **Dragòn** [Dragòn - 2D Scroller Game](https://youtu.be/oxvbj1901CQ) - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/LienoPC/Dragon--2D-Scroller-Game)
    - Gained experience with C++ coding principles and data structures in the context of game development, while also working with OpenGL graphics library.
      Specifically, I worked on the design and implementation of:
      - Main game loop system
      - Graphics classes (sprite_renderer, shader, texture, post_processor)
      - Post processing shaders
      - Gameplay logic, data structures for increasing difficulty and levels (game_level, game_object, bullet)

## Other Projects

### 🎞 "The Postman" Animation Reproduction
CGI reproduction of "The Postman" ad spot, project for the “Computer Animation” exam at Politecnico di Torino. Created a 30-second 3D-animated video using Blender; worked specifically on:
- Modeling, rigging and animation of the dog  
- Scene animation using modern keyframing and motion techniques
- Video sections on which I worked: 0:11-0:13; 0:18-0:23, 0:27-0:29 (fence)
